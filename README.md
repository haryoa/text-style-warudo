# Text Style Warudo

Still in progress. A collection of composable text style transfer techniques in Deep Learning. I plan to make the code as easy to use as possible and readable.

## Planned Implementation

Unsupervised GAN-like architecture:

- So Different Yet So Alike! Constrained Unsupervised Text Style Transfer

Evaluation
- A B C D

In the future
- Style prompting go brr
